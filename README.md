Bank spring application

Task:
Design and implement a REST API that allows to manage Users and their Accounts.
Each User (first name, last name, address, phone number, email, birthday) can have
many accounts. An Account (account type, balance, creating date, status) can be assigned
to the only one user . Account could not exist without user.
Each User also have one Main account, that could be any from the active accounts,
assigned to user. Main account should be necessary defined if User have at least one active
account.
REST API should provide CRUD endpoints for User and Account.
Also should be implemented additional endpoints for each of next operations:

- get a list of all users
- get a list of all accounts
- get a list of all accounts by user
- get a main account by user
- 
  Key points:
  • API should follow REST conventions
  • use Spring MVC (using Spring Boot is prohibited!)
  • use Spring Data JPA/Hibernate
  • use PostgreSQL
  • project should consist of a SQL script, that initializes all required database tables
  • project should be pushed to Github

This task requires the creation of a database, a user, and two tables.

CREATE TABLE users(
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
first_name CHARACTER VARYING(10) NOT NULL,
last_name CHARACTER VARYING(30) NOT NULL,
adress CHARACTER VARYING(75) NOT NULL,
phone_number CHARACTER VARYING(30) NOT NULL,
e_mail CHARACTER VARYING(30) NOT NULL,
birthday TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE accounts(
id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
account_type DECIMAL NOT NULL,
balance DECIMAL NOT NULL,
creating_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
status CHARACTER VARYING(10) NOT NULL,
user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT users_accounts_id_fk FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);
